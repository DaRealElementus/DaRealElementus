 Hi, Iâ€™m @DaRealElementus, I'm a stupid idiot sometimes, but i make cool stuff (in overthunk ways). I currently know python, java, html, css and sql.
 I started programming in 2018 on scratch.mit.edu (like most people) under the guise prof-21_, a name that has since been retired. I love gamedev and plan to expolre a career in it
 my love for gamedev stemmed from Halo 4, it simply amazed me how 343i put such a resouce intensive game onto an outdating hardware. 

 i love python (insert sarcasm)
