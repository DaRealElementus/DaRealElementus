Hi, Iâ€™m @DaRealElementus, I'm a stupid idiot sometimes, but I make cool stuff (in overthunk ways). I currently know Python, Java, Blazor, .NET and SQL.<br>
I started programming in 2018 on scratch.mit.edu (like most people) under the guise prof-21_, a name that has since been retired. I love Gamedev, Robotics and CyberSecurity.<br>
my love for Gamedev stemmed from Halo 4, it simply amazed me how 343i put such a resouce intensive game onto an outdating hardware. <br>
My love for Robotics stemmed from the idea of robots, being an avid Sci-fi enjoyer insipered me to purse robotics.<br>
My love for CyberSec stemmed from Keeping Data and therefore people safe.<br>
